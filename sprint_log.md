 ## Connor Fergesen
 * As a Stegnographer, I want to hide a .txt file inside an image, 
so that the secrets inside the .txt file don't get read by the wrong people.
   * Weeks: 2
   * Confirmation: Give a .txt file to the program you want to be hidden. The program will display the before and after image.
 * As a Steganographer, I want to retrieve a .txt file from an image so that I can read it.
   * Weeks: 2

 ## Austin Scott
 * As a programmer, I want a fixed length header to guide my file discovery algorithm so that we stop decrypting at the end of the hidden file.
   * Weeks: 1
   * Confirmation: Given an image with a file hidden in it, as well as a greed level, there will be a function that will determine the hidden file's type (text/image) and the size (length/shape).
 * As a developer, I want an optimized algorithm so that our program runs faster and uses less memory. 
   * Confirmation: The four algorithms written to find and hide data inside images won't take any uneccessary steps and they will use only the memory that they need to.
   * Weeks: 2
 * As a programmer, I want a Javascript Pseudocode layout of our algorithm. This should give me an idea of the structure that my team and I will need to follow when we implement our core hide/find functions.
   * Confirmation: JavaScript functions that demonstrate the basic functionality of hiding and finding hidden data inside PNG images.
   * Weeks: 1

 ### Austin's Log
 * (11/27/2018)
   * What did I do? Worked on designing the meta data header file that stores the hidden file type. For images it stores the dimensions and for text files it stores the length.
   * What do I plan to do? I plan to work on implementing the function that reads the header from an image from having the greed level.
   * Is there anything that is blocking me? Not at the moment.
   * What is your percent chance that the team will finish this sprint on time? 90-95% 
 * (11/29/2018)
   * What did I do? I implmented the functions for finding and hiding images which work directly with the header file data.
   * What do I plan to do? I plan to test/debug those functions and clean them up with some comments.
   * Is there anything that is blocking me? I need the functions setBit(), getBit(), and getByte() to test those functions.
   * What is the percent chance that the team will finish this sprint on time? 93%
 * (12/04/2018)
   * What did I do? Testing the functions that I wrote last time.
   * What do I plan to do? I plan to continue testing and debugging the functions for hiding images. 
   * Is there anything that is blocking me? Like last time I still need the functions for setBit(), getBit(), and getByte().
   * What is the percent chance that the team will finish on time? 85%
 * (12/06/2018)
   * What did I do? I tested and debugged the findImage and hideImage functions. 
   * What do I plan to do? I plan to help implement the findText and hideText functions as well as help convert BasicImage to a physical png file.
   * Is there anything that is blocking me? Not at the time.
   * What is the percent chance that the team will finish on time? 93%
 * (12/11/2018)
   * What did I do? I combined all of the finished hiding and finding functions into a single operational test prototype.
   * What do I plan to do? I plan to hook up the back-end javascript code to our front-end interface and fix any problems that will inevitably arise from doing so.
   * Is there anything that is blocking me? The front end interface still needs to be finished before I can properly use it.
   * What is the percent chance that the team will finish on time? 95%
 * (12/13/2018)
   * What did I do? I found the bug that plagued our team last time. Then I hooked the back-end up to the front-end. 
   * What do I plan to do? I plan to help fix whatever needs to be finished. 
   * Is there anything that is blocking me? Nope. 
   * What is the percent chance that the team will finish on time? 99.9%
